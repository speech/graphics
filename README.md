## Contributing
We strongly encourage contributing changes back to the project, see the usage policy below.

Generally, edit the Illustrator (.ai) files.  Note that they use linking, so changes to speech-logo-bird.ai will propogate automatically to all of the Illustrator containing the bird image.  __Note that I tried doing this with SVG to keep everything editable in free-software viewers, but neither Illustrator nor Inkscape can handle linking SVG files.__

Before submitting a pull requrest, please convert the Illustrator files to SVG files, open up batch-convert-svg.jsx in Illustrator using File -> Scripts -> Other Script.

Favicons are generated using [RealFaviconGenerator.net](http://realfavicongenerator.net).

## Usage Policy
###Design
There are some formal guidelines for usage below, but if you have artistic bent **please disregard them**.  We want to encourage the artistic expression of the logo in all forms and we ask that you release the original files as [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) or [public domain](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/).  While we prefer strong copyleft licenses (A/GPLv3) for code, we feel that attribution requirements only frustrate usage and that trademark law offers the best protection for image marks.

###Legal
Speech.is has a very liberal usage policy: don't use it for evil and we won't enforce our trademark rights.  What's evil?  Well, we think censorship is pretty evil.  We don't like racists or sexists either.

## Suggestions
Keep some padding around the images, the default sizes include some that we think look good.  The black logomark on the purple background doesn't work very well and we would love to see any variations you come up with!
